# Getting-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project
Repo to submit course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course. Includes script with code, ReadMe and CodeBook

The script `run_analysis.R` produces a tidy data set of averages of certain values found in the downloaded folder *UCI HAR Dataset*.
This initial dataset includes data obtained from accelerators in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, used both in *test* and *train* environments.
This data includes direct measurements and Fourier transformations of those, in multiple dimensions. 
In particular, those that are mean and standard deviation of the main measurements, identified by the addendum to the name *-mean()* or *-std()*, are the ones that the instructions demand to have averaged by subject exercising and type of activity measured.
